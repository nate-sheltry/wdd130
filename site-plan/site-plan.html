      <h3>Dungeons and Dragons: 5<sup>th</sup>  Edition</h3>
      <p>
        Summary:<br>
        Dungeons and Dragons is the most iconic tabletop game with its twenty-sided die system. Whether doing physical feats, using a skill, or attempting to attack, it is all done with the twenty-sided die. Character stats range from 1-20 and determine your capabilities in performing other tasks and what skills you are proficient with. This proficiency increases your success chances when rolling on a skill.
      </p><p>
        What sets Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition apart from other tabletop systems is its use of a singular bonus determined by its character level, along with streamlined conditional effects. This bonus is used for: skills, weapons, items, saving throws, spells, and other things the character is trained in. The simple way of leveling is combined with unique abilities being tied to what type of class a character is playing. Classes determine what a character can specialize in and how the character’s level progression is done. The game manages to streamline conditional effects by using a system of advantage/disadvantage where the player rolls twice. If one has advantage, they take the higher of the two rolls. If one has disadvantage, they take the lower of the two rolls.
      </p><p> 
        The simplicity of the system, the use of a singular die for ability checks, and the diversity between classes make Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition a fun and easy game to jump into. It is this simplicity that also makes it a great game for bigger groups of players.

      <h3>Fallout Pen and Paper</h3>
      <p>
        Summary:<br>
        Fallout Pen and Paper is based on the popular computer game franchise, Fallout, and is a tabletop system based on the 100-sided die and the ten-sided die.  The game is based on the code and mechanics of the original computer games and as such can require a lot of calculations. The simplest aspect of the game is character progression and leveling. Players decide their character's primary stats and the skills in which they will specialize. Stats are based on a 1-10 system, while skills are calculated from the character's stats and skill checks are rolled with a 100-sided die. Due to all the penalties that can occur when doing a skill check, Fallout Pen and Paper has no cap on skill values. Instead, skills become harder to increase the higher their value.
        </p><p>
        Due to The Game’s origins as a computer program, it has a lot of variables when deciding when someone succeeds on a skill check. This, and the fact that there is no common core rulebook for the game, ends up making it a harder system to learn and play.
        </p><p>
        The common rules and mechanics between game versions are regarding skills and secondary statistics. The game requires characters to focus on three skills of their choosing. As characters level, they gain special abilities called perks which affect them in various ways: including bonus damage, bonus movement, removing penalties from doing certain actions, bonuses when doing skill checks, and the ability to do some things not possible without the specific perk.
