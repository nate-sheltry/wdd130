            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p> &emsp;&emsp;Fallout Pen and Paper is based on the popular computer game franchise, Fallout, and is a tabletop system based on the 100-sided die and the ten-sided die. 
                The game is based on the code and mechanics of the original computer games and as such can require a lot of calculations. 
                The simplest aspect of the game is character progression and leveling. Players decide their character's primary stats and the skills in which they will specialize. 
                Stats are based on a 1-10 system, while skills are calculated from the character's stats and skill checks are rolled with a 100-sided die. 
                Due to all the penalties that can occur when doing a skill check, Fallout Pen and Paper has no cap on skill values. 
                Instead, skills become harder to increase the higher their value.
            </p>
            <p> &emsp;&emsp;Due to The Gameâ€™s origins as a computer program, it has a lot of variables when deciding when someone succeeds on a skill check. 
                This, and the fact that there is no common core rulebook for the game, ends up making it a harder system to learn and play.
            </p>
            <p> &emsp;&emsp;The common rules and mechanics between game versions are regarding skills and secondary statistics. 
                The game requires characters to focus on three skills of their choosing. 
                As characters level, they gain special abilities called perks which affect them in various ways: 
                including bonus damage, bonus movement, removing penalties from doing certain actions, bonuses when doing skill checks, and the ability to do some things not possible without the specific perk.

            <h2>Game Basis</h2>
            <p> &emsp;&emsp;Fallout Pen and Paper as mentioned above was based on the fallout video games, specifically Fallout, Fallout 2, and Fallout: Tactics. 
                Due to there being no general rulebook, often mechanics and game rules are based off these games systems. 
                Below you can browse and get a sense of each games mechanics.
