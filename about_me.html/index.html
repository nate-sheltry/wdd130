            <h2>Nathaniel Dunham</h2>
            <h2>N/A</h2>
            <p>Hello! my name is Nathaniel Dunham. I am 21 years-old, am single and have lived in three corners of the United States.
                Mainly: Vermont, Georgia, and Arizona. I've lived in Idaho for school, have visited Utah quite a bit, and served my mission in New York State.
                I've always had a liking of coding and programming, however html was not my favorite as a teen.</p>
            <p>I've been a member of the Church my whole life, however I really started to take religion seriously once I started doing early morning seminary.
                The teachers and friends I had while in seminary changed the course of my life and showed me the blessings that came from choosing to live a Christ centered life.
                I moved across the country my senior year of high school into a ward where I was the only active priest.
                It would've been easy to go inactive as the only young man of my age group, but instead I chose to follow the examples of my great teachers from seminary!</p>
            <p>People are my purpose in life. I don't like going to places, I like visiting people. 
                Don't get me in a group though, yikes! I write music as a hobby and like games such as Catan and 'Axis and Allies'.
                My current degree is focused towards software development. I'd like to maybe work on app development, even though making GUI's is not my cup of tea.</p>
            <p>Thank you for checking out my web page; I look forward to getting to know all of you this semester!</p>
